# CTF Tools

Original Author: Paul McDowell


## About

I initially created this eclectic set of tools because I needed them for random tasks and I was tired of writing the same things on-the-fly repeatedly. Once began attending CTF (capture the flag) events online however, the toolset started growing a lot more - along with the need to save them somewhere better. So here we are, a bunch of tools you can probably use to compete against me with. Great idea, right? Right.

Anyway here you are, feel free to use them; but don't use them to cheat. If you do, I hope you get caught and I assure you it won't be my fault. Only use these for learning, research, and when appropriately allowed by your CTF of choice.
